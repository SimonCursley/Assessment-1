/* This program offers four options it uses a 'DO WHILE' loop. It will run the program while true and stop when false.
   It uses switch with the 'choice' variable to choose the case to run a program. When the program that the user choose
   ends switch ends and the loop continues and the meny is shown again. The DO loops until exit.   */
